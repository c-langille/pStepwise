# pStepwise
This is the first working version of an R package I am building.  The package is used for choosing the "best" predictors in a linear model
based on their p-values.  There are a lot of libraries that will let the user choose the "best" model - but most of these rely on
AIC, BIC or something similar.  Basically, it is an attempt to create a function to allow one to automate the procedure found here: https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat501/node/329
