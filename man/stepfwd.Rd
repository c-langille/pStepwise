\title{Adds a single predictor to a linear model based on its p-value}
\usage{
stepfwd(fitCurrent, fullmodel, aEnter = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{fitCurrent}{the current model of type "lm"}

\item{fullmodel}{a linear model containing all possible predictors.  Typically of the form lm(y~., data=data)}

\item{aEnter}{the threshold for adding the predictor, set to 0.1 be default}
}
\value{
an updated linear model of type "lm"
}
\description{
This function will try and add a new predictor to a current model.  A predictor will be added if it has minimum p-value among all predictors and its p-value is below a certain threshold
}
