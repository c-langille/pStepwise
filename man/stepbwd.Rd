\title{Removes a single predictor from a linear model based on its p-value}
\usage{
stepbwd(fitCurrent, fullmodel, aRemove = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{fitCurrent}{the current model of type "lm"}

\item{fullmodel}{a linear model containing all possible predictors.  Typically of the form lm(y~., data=data)}

\item{aRemove}{the threshold for removing the predictor, set to 0.1 by default}
}
\value{
an updated linear model of type "lm"
}
\description{
This function will try and remove a single predictor from a current linear model.  A predictor will be removed if it has maximal p-value and its p-value is greater than a certain threshold.
